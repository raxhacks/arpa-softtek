We think it is now more\\ntractable than ever to make rapid iterative empirical progress toward solving this problem.\\n2 R ELATED WORK\\nWe study how we can leverage the generalization properties of deep neural networks to solve weak-\\nto-strong learning. Our problem setting and methods are closely connected to many existing research\\nareas.\\nWeakly-supervised learning. Weak-to-strong learning is a special type of weakly supervised\\nlearning—a setting in which models are trained using unreliable labels (Bach et al., 2017; Rat-', metadata={'source': '/Users/luisbarajas/Documents/AGI/Papers/weak-to-strong-generalization.pdf', 'page': 3}), Document(page_content='ner et al., 2017; Guo et al., 2018). There is also a rich literature on the related problem of learning\\nfrom noisy labels (Song et al., 2022). Common methods include bootstrapping (Reed et al., 2014;\\nHan et al., 2018; Li et al., 2020), noise-robust losses (Zhang & Sabuncu, 2018; Hendrycks et al.,\\n2018; Ma et al., 2020), and noise modeling (Yi & Wu, 2019). Unlike most work on label noise, the\\nerrors in our weak supervision are much harder to address than uniform label noise, instead having\\n“instance-dependent” errors (Fr ´enay & Verleysen, 2013). Semi-supervised learning, in which la-\\nbels are only available for a subset of the data, is also closely related (Kingma et al., 2014; Laine &\\nAila, 2016; Berthelot et al., 2019). We could also study our problem in a semi-supervised setting by\\nhaving an “easy” subset of examples that weak supervisors provide reliable labels for and a subset\\nof unlabeled “hard” examples that the weak supervisor can’t reliably label, a problem which we call', metadata={'source': '/Users/luisbarajas/Documents/AGI/Papers/weak-to-strong-generalization.pdf', 'page': 3}), Document(page_content='“easy-to-hard generalization” (see Appendix C).\\nStudent-teacher training. The framework of first training a teacher and then training a student on\\nteacher’s pseudo-labels is widely used in semi-supervised learning (Laine & Aila, 2016; Tarvainen\\n& Valpola, 2017; Xie et al., 2020), domain adaptation (French et al., 2017; Shu et al., 2018), and\\nknowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2015; Gou et al., 2021; Stanton et al., 2021; Beyer et al., 2022).\\nIn contrast to most prior work, we focus on the setting where the student is much more capable than\\nthe teacher.\\nFurlanello et al. (2018) and Xie et al. (2020) also consider cases where the student is at least as\\ncapable as the teacher. However in their settings the student is randomly initialized and has access\\nto ground truth labels. Moreover, compared to most past work we are focused on qualitatively very\\nweak supervision. For example, we are interested in huge leaps in generalization, similar to going', metadata={'source': '/Users/luisbarajas/Documents/AGI/Papers/weak-to-strong-generalization.pdf', 'page': 3}), Document(page_content='from “3rd grade-level” supervisors to “12th grade-level” student models. Despite these differences\\nwith past work, we expect many methods from semi-supervised learning and domain adaptation to\\ntranslate to our setting. For example, we found that a type of confidence auxiliary loss similar to\\npast work (Grandvalet & Bengio, 2004) improves weak-to-strong generalization in Section 4.3.\\nRobustness of pretraining and finetuning. Many papers have shown that pretraining\\non massive, diverse data leads to more robust representations that generalize better out-of-\\ndistribution (Hendrycks et al., 2019; 2020b; Radford et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022). Finetuning typ-\\nically improves in-distribution generalization, but often performs poorly out-of-distribution, some-\\ntimes even degrading performance relative to zero-shot prompting (Kumar et al., 2022; Wortsman\\net al., 2022b; Awadalla et al., 2022). Recent approaches to mitigating this problem include weight', metadata={'source': '/Users/luisbarajas/Documents/AGI/Papers/weak-to-strong-generalization.pdf', 'page': 3}), Document(page_content='ensembling (Wortsman et al., 2022b;a), finetuning only a subset of layers (Kirichenko et al., 2023;\\nLee et al., 2022a), or mitigating the distortion effects that finetuning has on pretrained features (Ku-\\nmar et al., 2022). We did not find strong results in preliminary explorations of approaches similar to\\nthese (Appendix B), but we expect that with more thorough explorations one may be able to attain\\nmuch stronger results with these or other ideas from the robust finetuning literature.\\nDebiasing. In weak-to-strong generalization, the weak labels contain a specific form of bias,\\nwhich results from the weak models’ lack of capability. There is a substantial literature on learning\\nfrom biased training data (Bellamy et al., 2018). However, most work focuses on known biases,\\nfor example where we know that the models perform worse on minority groups. For known biases,\\ncommon methods include Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (Sagawa et al., 2019), adver-\\n4', metadata={'source': '/Users/luisbarajas/Documents/AGI/Papers/weak-to-strong-generalization.pdf', 'page': 3}), Document(page_content='sarial training (Zhang et al., 2018), and model editing (Santurkar et al., 2021; Meng et al., 2022).\\nIn contrast, our setting can be viewed as a particularly difficult debiasing problem where the bias is\\nunknown. Some methods that automatically discover and mitigate biases include clustering (Sohoni\\net al., 2020), loss variance reduction (Khani et al., 2019), and auditing and re-training on high-loss\\ngroup (Kim et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2021).\\nImitation and preference learning. The goal of alignment is to steer already-capable models\\nto do what we want them to do. For example, the base GPT-4 model is good at generating text\\nfollowing its pretraining distribution, but does not readily follow instructions. To align pretrained\\nlanguage models today, we finetune them using imitation learning on human demonstrations (Bain\\n& Sammut, 1995; Atkeson & Schaal, 1997) or by using methods such as reinforcement learning', metadata={'source': '/Users/luisbarajas/Documents/AGI/Papers/weak-to-strong-generalization.pdf', 'page': 4}), Document(page_content='from human feedback (RLHF) (Christiano et al., 2017; Stiennon et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022;\\nGlaese et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022a). Constitutional AI (Bai et al., 2022b; Lee et al., 2023) leverages\\nAI feedback to align language models, but still uses an initial RLHF phase. However, both imitation\\nlearning and preference learning assume high-quality human supervision, making it unclear if they\\nwill work for superhuman models.\\nScalable oversight. Scalable oversight techniques aim to improve the ability of humans to super-\\nvise models. For example, humans may ask models to critique the outputs of other models (Irving\\net al., 2018; Saunders et al., 2022) or use models to help decompose a problem into simpler sub-\\nproblems (Leike et al., 2018; Christiano et al., 2018; Lightman et al., 2023). Scalable oversight\\nmethods typically take advantage of special problem structure, like decomposability or the fact that', metadata={'source': '/Users/luisbarajas/Documents/AGI/Papers/weak-to-strong-generalization.pdf', 'page': 4}), Document(page_content='evaluation is easier than generation. In contrast to improving human supervision, we focus on gener-\\nalizing beyond human supervision such that models perform well even in settings we cannot reliably\\nsupervise. That said, our weak-to-strong learning setup can be used to compare scalable oversight\\nmethods, generalization-based methods, and more. Our setup also resembles a proposal for measur-\\ning progress on scalable oversight known as “sandwiching”, which uses weak and strong humans\\n(Cotra, 2021; Bowman, 2022).\\nKnowledge elicitation and honesty. Christiano et al. (2022) introduced a theoretical problem\\ncalled Eliciting Latent Knowledge (ELK), in which the goal is to elicit latent knowledge from a su-\\nperhuman machine learning model even under worst case assumptions. For example, a special case\\nof ELK is honesty (Evans et al., 2021), where the goal is for the models to report their true beliefs2.', metadata={'source': '/Users/luisbarajas/Documents/AGI/Papers/weak-to-strong-generalization.pdf', 'page': 4}), Document(page_content='Wentworth (2020) hypothesizes a tendency for neural networks to develop “natural abstractions”\\nthat are easier to elicit. Recent empirical work on ELK includes a benchmark for measurement\\ntampering (Roger et al., 2023), methods for discovering latent knowledge (Burns et al., 2023), and\\nstudies of honesty (Li et al., 2023; Pacchiardi et al., 2023). Our setting can be viewed as a general\\nmethodology for empirically studying problems like ELK and honesty across a wide range of tasks.\\n3 M ETHODOLOGY\\nA core challenge of superalignment is that humans will need to supervise models much smarter than\\nus. This is a special case of what we call the weak-to-strong learning problem : how can a weak\\nsupervisor oversee a model much smarter than it?

Intuitively, this should correspond to “everything\\nthe strong model knows,” i.e. the strong model applying its full capabilities to the task.\\nFor more details on how we train each model, see Appendix A.\\nTypically, weak-to-strong performance will be between weak performance and strong ceiling per-\\nformance.

If we achieve perfect weak-\\nto-strong generalization, PGR is 1. If the weak-to-strong model does no better than the weak super-\\nvisor, then PGR is 0.\\nAdvantages.

A critical step of RLHF is to train a reward model (RM)\\nto predict human preferences between model responses.

Finally, the assistant model is trained by optimizing against the reward model\\nwith reinforcement learning (RL). In our work, we do not study the RL step, and instead assume the\\ngoal is to maximize reward model accuracy. For more details on reward models, see e.g. Ouyang\\net al. (2022).

We use popular NLP classification benchmark datasets listed in Table 1. We\\nobfuscate the names of the datasets in our plots (e.g. Figure 12) for confidentiality; across all figures,\\nwe replace the names of the datasets with their order in a randomized sequence. We apply various\\npreprocessing to the datasets. For example, some tasks are in FLAN (Wei et al., 2021) and we use\\ntheir preprocessing. For ANLI we group neutral entailments with contradictions. We convert each\\ndataset to a binary classification problem. For multiple-choice datasets, suppose each datapoint has\\na question Qand multiple candidate answers A1, . . . , A k. We then convert this datapoint to knew\\ndatapoints of the form (Q, A i), where the label is 0for all incorrect answers Aiand1for the correct\\nanswers.

We are also additionally rebalancing the classes in\\ndatasets where one of the classes represents more than 55% of the data.

In order to adapt our language models to the classification setting, we replace the un-\\nembedding layer of the model with a linear classification head with two outputs.

Specifically, we extract a representation\\nX∈Rn×dof the SciQ dataset using a model of an intermediate size in the GPT-4 family, where n\\nis the number of datapints, and dis the dimensionality of the residual stream (Elhage et al., 2021).\\nWe can then consider the family of linear models10Mkwhere k≤dby training a linear probe only\\non the first kfeatures extracted by the model.

To construct\\nthese labels, we start from ground truth, and then flip a subset of labels to match the accuracy of a\\nparticular weak model. We target a few types of error structures, such as pure noise, easy-to-model\\nbias, hard-to-model bias, and adversarial bias.\\nIn particular, we looked at:\\n1.weak supervisor : the baseline — labels are generated in the same way as in the rest of\\nthe paper\\n2.random : flip the label of random datapoints\\n3.longest prompt : flip the label of longest datapoints by characters\\n4.shortest prompt : flip the label of shortest datapoints by characters', metadata={'source': '/Users/luisbarajas/Documents/AGI/Papers/weak-to-strong-generalization.pdf', 'page': 43}), Document(page_content='5.strong g.t. model unconfident : flip the label of the datapoints that the strong ceil-\\ning model is most unconfident on\\n6.strong g.t. model confidently correct : flips the label of the datapoints that the\\nstrong ceiling model is most confidently correct on\\nDespite all of these weak labelers having the same weak accuracy, we find that the generalization\\ncan vary wildly depending on the structure of the weak errors. We report the results in Figure 25.\\nFurthermore, the dynamics of supervisor-student agreement through training can have qualitatively\\ndifferent behavior (Figure 26). For errors coming from a weak model, we see that there is often ini-\\ntially a period of generalization, followed by a period of overfitting where it learns the weak model’s\\nerrors. The confidence auxiliary loss mitigates this overfitting. For easy-to-fit error structures such\\naslongest prompt , the overfitting happens much faster. For other kinds of errors, such as random', metadata={'source': '/Users/luisbarajas/Documents/AGI/Papers/weak-to-strong-generalization.pdf', 'page': 43}), Document(page_content='noise, we often see that generalization improves throughout: weak errors are not modeled, but the\\nsignal from the weak model is.\\nE.3 M AKING IMITATION TRIVIAL\\nOne possible major disanalogy in our setup, as discussed in Section 6.1, is the fact that our models\\nare not very good at imitating the weak model11(Section 5.1.3), but superhuman models may be\\nvery good at imitating humans. It is possible that if the strong model were good at imitating the\\nweak model, then it would generalize substantially less desirably by default.\\nTo test an extreme version of this hypothesis, we create a synthetic setting where the strong model\\ncan trivially imitate the weak model very well. In particular, we modify the task by appending “I\\nthink this is {weak label }.
