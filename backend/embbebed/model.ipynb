      "• The desired generalization should be “ natural ” or “ salient ” to the model. For example, we\n",

      "• Can we reliably estimate generalization error at test time without any labels? For example,\n",
      "can we measure the degree of weak-to-strong underspecification (Lee et al., 2022b)?\n",
      "• Can we reliably extrapolate generalization error across many orders of magnitude using\n",

      "• How important are the errors in the weak supervision, precisely? How do different kinds\n",
      "of weak label biases affect generalization?\n",

      "Here, we provide further details on our experiments. Across all tasks, we use pretrained base models\n",
      "from the GPT-4 family (OpenAI, 2023), spanning a range of model sizes.\n",
      "A.1 NLP T ASKS\n",
      "Data preprocessing. We use popular NLP classification benchmark datasets listed in Table 1. We\n",
      "obfuscate the names of the datasets in our plots (e.g. Figure 12) for confidentiality; across all figures,\n",
      "we replace the names of the datasets with their order in a randomized sequence. We apply various\n",
      "preprocessing to the datasets. For example, some tasks are in FLAN (Wei et al., 2021) and we use\n",
      "their preprocessing. For ANLI we group neutral entailments with contradictions. We convert each\n",
      "dataset to a binary classification problem. For multiple-choice datasets, suppose each datapoint has\n",
      "a question Qand multiple candidate answers A1, . . . , A k. We then convert this datapoint to knew\n",
      "datapoints of the form (Q, A i), where the label is 0for all incorrect answers Aiand1for the correct\n",
      "answers. In this procedure, we also aim to maintain class balance, so we keep the same number\n",
      "of correct and wrong answers per question6. We are also additionally rebalancing the classes in\n",
      "datasets where one of the classes represents more than 55% of the data. To do so, we randomly drop\n",
      "datapoints from the dominant class, so that the classes are perfectly balanced.\n",
      "Models. In order to adapt our language models to the classification setting, we replace the un-\n",
      "embedding layer of the model with a linear classification head with two outputs. We initialize the\n",
      "weights of the classification head with the unembedding weights for tokens “0” and “1”.\n",
      "Training hyperparameters. We finetune all models for 2 epochs using a batch size of 32. In\n",
      "the weak-to-strong generalization experiments, we early stop training based on the accuracy with\n",
      "respect to the weak labels on a held-out validation set. See Section 5.1.1 for relevant discussion.\n",
      "We only tuned the hyper-parameters of our methods on smaller model sizes, and on a subset of 8\n",
      "datasets. The full GPT-4 model and most of the datasets were held-out, except for datasets [5–12]\n",
      "(see Figure 12).\n",
      "Weak labels. To produce the weak labels, we split the original dataset in half. We ensure that\n",
      "related datapoints, e.g. datapoints that share the same question or premise, are always grouped to-\n",
      "gether into the same half. Then, we train the weak supervisor model on the first half of the dataset,\n",
      "and use its prediction on the other half as the weak labels. We additionally save the weak labels on\n",

      "on the training data, i.e. the class probabilities predicted by the supervisor.\n",
      "Evaluation. For all datasets, we report accuracy on the test set which is also balanced to have an\n",
